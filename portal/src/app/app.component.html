    CoCoRaHS (pronounced KO-ko-rozz) is a grassroots volunteer network of backyard weather observers of all ages and
    backgrounds working together to measure and map precipitation (rain, hail and snow) in their local communities. By
    using low-cost measurement tools, stressing training and education, and utilizing an interactive Website, our aim is
    to provide the highest quality data for natural resource, education and research applications. The only requirements
    to join are an enthusiasm for watching and reporting weather conditions and a desire to learn more about how weather
    can affect and impact our lives.
    <br /><br />
    Our Web page provides the ability for our observers to see their observations mapped out in "real time", as well as
    providing a wealth of information for our data users.
    <br /><br />
    All of this data is in the public domain and free for you to explore and utilize in your research and commercial
    projects.
    <br /><br />

    questions you can answer and the for instructions on how easy it is for you to get the data.
