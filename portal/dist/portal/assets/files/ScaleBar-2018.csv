The pine trees colors are still alright but on the south side of the more exposed ones the needles are turning that dull yellowish green . The larger hawks seem to have disappeared for now but still seen plenty of smaller falcons as one just made a sweep at one of our cats sitting next to my wife outside . Still have a few blue jays hanging around and a red shafted flicker besides the normal sparrows, finch, quail, and pigeons plus a few western red wing blackbirds. On warmer days I'm refilling the bird baths 3 x's a day.  This is the first time I have seen deer at night around here , several times at bird feeders and baths , this time of year , in four years . They have only been here day and night in the spring time to eat mostly the lilac blossoms , we have a lot. The lilacs new growth buds still look plump/healthy and the crab trees but the ash and elm buds look smaller and a little drier . The rain, we had a pretty heavy burst last night, and snow when melted and it warmed above freezing did moisten up the very top layer of the soil some . Hopefully some time this spring we finally get a wet period and or La Nina loosens here grip. I did still see some running water from some springs at a park in Falcon this last week and there still is some frozen small ponds and just natural wet areas in the fields around the Falcon are that are still frozen . Since Dec. 24th it has been 1 degree, 4 degrees, 16 degrees last night and 63 degrees and only 37 degrees for a low one night. We went through more wood with our stove during roughly the Xmas to New Year time period than this last week , but what helps us if there is enough sun we have 3 just about floor to ceiling bay type windows in our front of the house that face WSW. and it will get to or maintain 80 degrees in the house even if it is about 24 degrees or warmer outside , if it's not to windy .

Walking through the watered field grass area to the non watered went from a noticeable crunchy to a soft mush sound , it was very noticeable even though it all looks dead and dormant , so it still helps. All wet areas and ponds I see around the area are all still frozen so can not really tell what the moisture content is . I know not to walk on any because water level can drop and you can not easily tell and you could easily fall through. I have fewer birds now , less blue jays dove , quail and blackbirds but always the diehards stick around .

It is mostly open prairie around here and about half the property of 5 acres is full of trees so half was almost swept clean while the treed area gets decent snow/moisture for them . The open areas are still crunchy dry and with the winds and dry plains I have trimmed up the trees from the ground level and thinned them out and removed the dead branches , plus I will continue to finish watering around the house , almost done . The one larger black and white woodpecker I thought was gone I just saw 2 days ago but the other bird population has remained the same . We have in the 3 yrs. we have lived here we have gone through more propane in 2 months than we do in 4 months plus have gone through more firewood for the stove , even though we have had less snow it still has been colder than warmer , at least we get nice warm breaks that help . The ground is colder , snow hanging around , bird baths staying more frozen and ground by outside spigot has maintained ice . Out in the fields their is not enough moisture in the soil to freeze except maybe were the grasses and native plants have not been cut the snow can settle in more but still not enough . We found three half eaten rabbits on the property so the predators are doing their job , we were overrun with them when we moved in , have been hearing owls at night when taking the dogs out at night . The tall field grasses protect wildlife but also do the trees and junipers/cedars so cutting the grasses around the house and the field I do not feel so bad . The house is surrounded on 3 sides by 3 to 4 rows of evergreens and on the east side some deciduous trees . The cracks in the ground , east side of house , are all but gone except for a couple faint traces . Again more snow is able to settle around the house but do not see the dry cracks in the field either . The trees , evergreens and shrubs appear the same as before , ok .

When I came back the ground was still showing signs of moisture at the surface from a recent storm , my wife said we had 2.5 inches ,  but it was a very cold snow so it did not contain a lot of moisture I hope at least .10 inches maybe . The moisture disappeared a couple days later when we had high winds with very low humidity's then we had some more snow about 2.4 inches that its liquid equivalent was .11 inches and the soil looks moist again and is tacky but we are going to have strong winds with low humidity's again that is going to dry the soil out again . Also while I was gone we had another brush fire about 4 miles due west of us with strong westerly winds I believe just before the snow we had before I got back causing me to come back 3 days early . The wife thought she heard it was 32 to 38 acres . I have not had a chance to check the depth of the soil moisture but just recently had to bury a dove , that appeared to have froze to death , with a Maddox because of frozen ground . I buried it on the west , sunny , side of my pines and could only get 6"" to 7"" deep but what I saw looked moist and frozen , hard to tell . The birds are eating even less so I keep cutting back . The bird baths have been mostly frozen and have had trouble freeing them up . One , a big stainless steel bowl , has been the easiest and can always free it of ice but the black satellite dish , 4' off the ground , has been harder than normal to free it of ice . I have seen less blue jays maybe a couple from time to time . The feeders are 7' off the ground to help keep the deer out of them , but they get what is spilled by the birds so I fill at a minimum twice daily . I can still tell the deer are almost here every night . They trigger our motion lights plus I see there hoof prints . They try to get the water before it's to frozen plus I have seen them munching on our lilac stem . The rabbits are the most destructive , we have had to chicken wire all our smaller trees because they kept mowing them to the ground . Now some have grown 5' to 6' over 3 years , mostly ash trees , plus we have a lot less rabbits . The evergreens are looking decent especially the ones that got watered then shortly after we got 2 somewhat decent snow's . The buds on the deciduous trees are smaller/tighter but still ok and their stems are still flexible . We still have some of the drifts left from a couple months ago , in the shaded area that now is all white again from the recent snows . I have been having to pick up more tumbleweeds , knap weed and Russian thistle , and pull them out of the upright junipers to minimize fire danger . Hopefully the winds start backing off . Looking forward to spring and hopeful moisture . Need some pounding thunderstorms . It was 6 degrees this AM. so had better get out to feed birds and break up the ice , at least it's sunny .

The propane company was very busy the last time and it took a while for them to get to us , almost a month . I have been staying up later and trying to keep the stove going trying to stretch out the propane until springtime .

I think that is largely because eastern parts of the county got more rain than we did here.  Many shrubs have already turned color and are dropping their leaves.  Orioles that appear and leave each year like clock work came a week later than usual and left about two weeks earlier than usual.  I'm not sure that was because of drought, but it was unusual. When I look at the color of the vegetation in this area it makes me think of September rather than late July.",2018.0,3.0,7.0,Jul,30.0,28.0

Relief, Response & Restrictions: Evacuations still in effect in both counties.  Numerous evacuees still waiting for news of their homes or awaiting re-population date.  Victim's advocates available; fire is a crime scene.  

Public health concerns: Water/Well contamination, post fire related injuries as clean-up/re-population starts, tetanus shots and protective eye wear, gloves, etc., being distributed by Red Cross and other relief agencies/organizations. Mental health services being provided.

Business & Industry; Tourism & Recreation: US 160 was closed for nearly two weeks due to fire (open now) -- major disruption and impact on tourism, recreation, restaurants and tourism-related businesses.  Detours for trucking and public up to 200 miles.  Potential for road/highway-blocking flash flooding in burn areas.

Plants & Wildlife; Water Supply & Quality: Most of the 107,000 acres burned was forest including Ponderosa Pine, Spruce, Pinyon Pine, Juniper, Aspen and under-story species.

Beyond the riparian area, the vegetation is looking somewhat like winter drab because the grasses never broke winter dormancy due to lack of soil moisture. Since the water year began on October 1 my rain gage collected a mere 1.69"" by June 30. During the previous seven years October 1 to June 30 averaged 5.10"", with the least amount (2.84"") in 2012-2013 -- note that in July 2013 the river stopped flowing and mostly dried up within my property. Prism modeling suggests that longterm average precipitation at my house October through June to be 9.58"". The long-range forecast for this July through September is for above-average precipitation, so hopefully the monsoons will be super wet. My wife and I have owned our land for 23 years and have never seen a spring with so little green-up of grasses and forbs. Our nearest year-around neighbor (2 miles away) does not recall such a paucity of green-up over the 50 years since she was a little girl here. Beyond the river's edge, this year the only green-up of grasses and forbs occurred immediately downhill from where large rocks concentrated the small amounts of rain received this spring, and those patches of green-up were only temporary. 

I have been observing a nearby raven nest for more than 15 years, and predicted that the nest would not be successful this year due to the drought. Instead this was one of the few years when two raven young successfully fledged. I suspect the fledging success was because the parents were able to collect large amounts of food from freshly exposed sandbars and cobble bars as the river level fell and fell -- I watched the parents spend large amount of time hunting in these locations that normally are under water during the raven nesting season.

Soil moisture at the end of winter was so little that the grasses and forbs on the uplands (away from the river) never greened up -- they never broke winter dormancy. Since we acquired our 280 acres at the beginning of 1995, we had never before seen a monsoon season (typically mid-July to mid-September) when we did not receive plenty of rain to turn the pastures bright green. However, the monsoon season is almost over and the upland grasses and forbs remain dormant -- we've had a few storms that dropped up to 1/4 inch of rain but the storms were separated by enough time that the soil never accumulated enough moisture for the grasses and forbs to break dormancy. In short, 11 months into the water year, and the upland grasses and forbs have not greened at all (except in some small locations where rocks concentrated the rainfall in the soil). As a plant ecologist, I'm left wondering whether most of the perennial grasses can survive a year and a half of dormancy until next spring (assuming they never break dormancy this year). Also wondering that if a strong storm does come that breaks their dormancy at the end of this ""growing season"", will that be good or actually hurt the long-term survival of the perennial grasses by them using their root reserves to begin growth while there is too little growing season left to replenish the reserves of nutrients in their roots.

The drought does appear to be killing off some unpalatable shrubs: almost all of the broom snakeweed (a native) appears to be dead, as does much or most of the black sagebrush (also a native). For many years I have wondered why those shrubs were not larger components of the ecosystem on our property, given their propensity to encroach over time when fire is not present in the grassland. Now I hypothesize that occasional severe droughts have been the mechanism that kept our pastures heavily dominated by native perennial grasses.",2018.0,3.0,8.0,Aug,35.0,31.0

The soil moisture at the end of last winter was so little that the grasses and forbs on the uplands (away from the river) never greened up -- they never broke winter dormancy (except in some small locations where rock concentrated the soil moisture). Since we acquired our 280 acres at the beginning of 1995, we had never before seen a monsoon season (typically mid-July to mid-September) when we did not receive plenty of rain to turn our pastures bright green. However, the monsoon season is over and the upland grasses and forbs remain dormant. We’ve had a few storms that dropped up to 1/4 inch of rain but the storms were separated by enough time that the soil never accumulated enough moisture for the grasses and forbs to break dormancy. Rain July 1 through September 30 this year totaled a mere 1.15 inch, while during the previous seven years July-September rain averaged 4.79 inches (range 2.75” to 7.38”). In short, the upland grasses and forbs on our 280 acres never greened at all during 2018 (except in some small locations where rocks concentrated the moisture in the soil).

As a plant ecologist, I'm left wondering whether most of the perennial grasses can survive a year and a half of dormancy until next spring (assuming they never break dormancy this October). I also wonder whether if a strong storm does come that breaks the grass dormancy at the very end of this ""growing season"", will that be good or actually hurt the long-term survival of the perennial grasses by causing them to use their root reserves to begin growth while there is too little growing season left to replenish the reserves of nutrients in their roots.

The drought does appear to be killing off some unpalatable shrubs: almost all of the broom snakeweed (a native) appears to be dead, as does much or most of the black sagebrush (also a native). For many years I have wondered why those shrubs were not larger components of the ecosystem on our property, given their propensity to encroach over time when fire is not present in the grassland. Now I hypothesize that occasional severe droughts have been the mechanism that kept our pastures heavily dominated by native perennial grasses.

Meanwhile we do not have the forage necessary to support the 9 bulls and 2 dozen steers that normally graze our 280 acres November through February.",2018.0,3.0,9.0,Sep,39.0,30.0
