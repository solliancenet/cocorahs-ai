We have had milder high temperatures and more dry wind than before but that's about the only thing to report this week.  I have noticed that aspen colors are variable this year.  Those on our place turned color but were more dull than usual while in other areas not too far away the colors are brighter.  In general, in my travels the aspen colors are brighter on the east side of the Continental divide.  I'm not sure why that is, but we did have a very dry summer overall in this general area, so maybe that had a little to do with it.",2017.0,3.0,9.0,Sep,38.0,23.0

The lilacs, some had started to turn, are damaged on the tops and north sides. The pines are looking very good, the wind blew out the inner natural browning needles. The cotoneasters are still a beautiful yellow, orange and red with the leaves but imagine they will discolor shortly and drop their leaves. It was in the twenties, 23 degree low, a good part of Monday night. I had left my hummingbird feeders out just in case of stragglers and they froze almost solid but they are ok.

Wasps have been the most problem they were everywhere looking for a spot to overwinter but being a little sluggish except on warmer days. It has been a problem with pets around but just in the last couple days they have basically disappeared after a couple nights @ 27 degrees. Our several coveys of quail have returned, they seem to be everywhere in the AM's and PM's. They usually disappear during the late summer for a several weeks then show back up in the fall time. The migration of different types of birds through the area has also ended. The top soil is looking drier but driving in metal t-post for a snow fence was a lot easier than I thought. The evergreens still have a good color to them. I hope we get some decent moisture soon and then a good and cold freeze. It has a tendency to help lock in some soil moisture with the help of a lower sun angle. The deciduous grasses, plants and trees during dormancy do not uptake much moisture but evergreens do and every time it warms a little they will be able to absorb some moisture.

After today that will be gone. The reason for being drier is that I have noticed in my travels in the area is that 2 different ponds in the area, one a good sized livestock ranch pond and the other a homeowners wildlife/fish pond, where about the lowest I have seen since Jan. 2015. Maybe they where lowered for cleaning except the ranch pond. As for insects before the snow I was still seeing some stragglers like wasp, fly, and a ladybug. The ground must still be warm enough in places. Referring to that I have 4 bird baths, 2 above ground and 2 on the ground. The baths on the ground have started to almost freeze solid on colder nights, before they were not freezing over at all. The birds have been definitely eating more in the last month as is an outdoor, garage cat, that I'm trying to befriend to get to the vet, a beautiful large male cat. I have been seeing a lot more chickadee's and finches lately plus it seems hundreds of sparrows and western red wing blackbirds. Well I hope we soon see a pattern change that allows for more moisture but for now it does not appear to be in our near future. At least most homeowners in the area are cutting their fields.

Our deciduous trees leaves are mostly gone except one crab apple and the elm, they probably slowly lose some as winter goes on then the rest right before leaf out in late spring. The lilacs on average still have almost half their leaves stuck on with pale yellow, pea green and rust brown leaves. A small heard of deer, 5, came through and found them edible. That was the first time for deer showing up in the fall, it always been in the spring. Up until this last snow and cold I had seen a few wasp and spiders and fly stragglers on the warmer days. We even had one fly in the house, not for long, in the house as it was snowing. Lots of quail, sparrows, dove and blue jays and one Steller's jay plus some red shafted flickers. The soil again, at the surface got moist and sticky but as I dragged my foot across the soil it exposed the dry underneath. I have not checked soil moisture depth yet. The evergreens are still looking good as is their color. We have a small section of blue grass in front for the dogs and it is still very green with the Mrs. only watering it about every other week lightly by hand and skipping a week when it snows. The wildlife, birds, deer and rabbits love it. At least the little bit of moisture keeps the dust down when cars drive by for a few days, wish people would slow down.   ",2017.0,4.0,11.0,Nov,45.0,9.0

Still seeing some spiders out side the house looking for a spot to over winter. Even found a small grasshopper trying to take refuge behind a package that had been delivered. We have not seen any more wasp around here but saw one yesterday in the Co. springs parking lot. Had to bury a dove a couple days ago and the ground was so hard and dry I had to use a mattock then shovel and it still was hard to dig a hole. I even dug the hole on the north side of a pine that I thought would be the easiest.

Our evergreens are just starting to pale in color just slightly and hope for a little more moisture like close to a half inch but do not see that happening any time soon. The birds that I feed are not going through the water I put out for them like they have in drier periods before, yet. The deciduous trees and shrubs buds have set for next years growth are looking healthy. Finally the elm and lilacs have lost the majority of their leaves. It is getting dustier by the day with vehicles driving down the road and the quarry close by so I am grateful for any amount of moisture like yesterdays to provide us a break.

I noticed where the areas that have reeds and cattails, a sign of springs or higher water table, that some areas still had pockets of water in them, they have not dried up yet to my surprise. Then yesterday I had to bury the remains of rabbit that a predator had gotten and dug down about ten inches and at about seven to eight inches I hit some darker slightly more moist soil. This was done on the west side of Co. blue upright junipers, cedars, and next to our dirt road we live off of on a slight slope facing west. I was a little surprised. I am still seeing a few insects like a lady bug and yellow jackets on the warmer days. The bird baths are not freezing so much anymore, especially the ones on the ground. The birds are going through less food and water also but that maybe is due to a large red tail hawk that has been hanging around. With all these warm nights and warm windy days and blowing dust at times it's got to be drying the plant life out. All I see are brown dormant fields with scattered area of trees around homeowners residents. Even the moss that grows on ground on the north side of trees and structures is tightening up and shrinking in size. I sure hope we get some decent moisture out of some possible weather systems next week. Keeping my fingers crossed. I get real nervous with days like yesterday. ",2017.0,4.0,11.0,Nov,48.0,28.0
